# EXPECTED OUTPUT FILE SIZES: 
# one psi for one atomic configuration for one slice for 150mrad diffangle = 25.9MB. 100 FP configs 8 slices 50 energies = 1TB
# (confirmation: for AlN_01b.txt, numFP=2, layerwise yielded 6 layers, 50 energies = 15.15GB of psi files)
# 100mrad will be 45% the size (100^2/150^2), numFP=50, 8 slices, 50 energies seems good = 227 GB. each psi file will be 4.55 GB
# numFP=10 (since we already have so many included with stacking?) it's 22.7 GB total and 466 MB per file
