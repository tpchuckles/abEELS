Si_5m_*.txt - 01-06 are a "unit test" of sorts: 01-03 are JACR, basic, thickness series, and multiple probe positions. 04-06 are the same but using PZ

Si_0m_01.txt - same material system as Si_5m_*.txt, but parallel-beam illuminuation (TEM vs STEM). cripy diffraction spots = crispy phonon dispersions

AlN_0m_01.txt - explores propagating one run's exit wave into another run (a thickness series, but without loading the entire thick simulation into ram at once). 

AlN_0m_01_combined.txt - this file is autogenerated when you kick off cyclesToLayers on AlN_0m_01.txt

AlN_30m_*.txt - 01 and 02 are JACR and PZ mode looking at the EELS response for a probe parked on the Al vs N atoms in AlN
